Database Migration

I hope the readers have the understanding on how to use laravel migration.

To use the file you have to run the Command Line on terminal

<b>$php artisan migrate:fresh or $php artisan migrate:refresh or $php artisan migrate --force</b>

If you put this file in another folder you must run

<b>$php artisan migrate:fresh --path=/database/myfolder</b>

if there is an error in migrating you can write <i>issues</i>

thank you
