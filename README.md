Database Migration

I hope the readers have the understanding on how to use laravel migration.

To use the file you have to run the Command Line on terminal

$php artisan migrate:fresh or $php artisan migrate:refresh or $php artisan migrate --force

If you put this file in another folder you must run

$php artisan migrate:fresh --path=/database/myfolder

if there is an error in migrating you can write issues

thank you
